Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is one of the powerful analytical techniques used in determining the structure of organic compounds. Isotopes of 1H, 13C, 19F, and 31P have I = 0.5 and are of great interest. 1H NMR or the proton NMR is the technique in which the hydrogen nuclei of the compound/substance are studied in order to determine the structure of the compound under study. The two most important characteristics of NMR spectra are the chemical shift and the coupling constant. This experiment deals with virtually recording the proton NMR spectra for a set of samples and analyzing them.
