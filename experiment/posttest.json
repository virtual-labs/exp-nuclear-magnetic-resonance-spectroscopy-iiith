      "explanations": {
        "a": "The splitting pattern depends on the number of protons on the neighbouring atom (n) using the formula (n+1). Methylene protons in propane belongs to CH&#8322 group in the middle which has 3 H atoms each on the neighbouring atoms. For triplet, n would be 2.",
        "b": "The splitting pattern depends on the number of protons on the neighbouring atom (n) using the formula (n+1). Methylene protons in propane belongs to CH&#8322 group in the middle which has 3 H atoms each on the neighbouring atoms. For quartet, n would be 3.",

      "question": "5. Which of the following statements about the energy of an applied magnetic field is FALSE?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "This energy can “flip” a proton from alignment with the field to alignment opposite the field.",
        "b": "Nuclei are “in resonance” when they absorb this energy.",
        "c": "This energy is proportional to the magnetic field strength.",
        "d": "This energy is supplied by radiation in the visible region of the spectrum."
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Energy of the applied magnetic field is equivalent to the splitting of the spin states and when this much energy is supplied, the spin of the proton changes from along the field to opposite the field.",
        "b": "Nuclei are in resonance when they absorb radiowave frequency and undergo flip.",
        "c": "The energy difference of the two spin states depends on the strength of the magnetic field applied .",
        "d": "The radiation supplied to cause the flip is radiowave. "
