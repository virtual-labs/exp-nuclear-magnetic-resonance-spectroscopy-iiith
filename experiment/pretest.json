      "question": "1. When an external magnetic field is applied, what happens to the protons in the sample?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "All protons align with the field.",
        "b": "All protons align opposite to the field.",
        "c": "Some protons align with the field and some align opposite to it.",
        "d": "All protons assume a random orientation. "
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Almost half of the protons align along the field.",
        "b": "Almost half of the protons align opposite to the field.",
        "c": "It is true that some protons align along and some align opposite the field and this difference in the number causes the signal to occur.",
        "d": "None of the protons assume random orientation. They either align along or opposite the field."

    {
      "question": "2. Which of the following is false about NMR experiment?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "The energy required to flip the spin of a proton is in the infrared region of the electromagnetic spectrum.",
        "b": "The energy difference between the two spin states depends on the strength of the magnetic field.",
        "c": "When energy absorption occurs, the nuclei are said to be in resonance with the electromagnetic radiation.",
        "d": "When a proton is aligned with the magnetic field, its energy is lower than when it is aligned against the magnetic field."
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "The energy required to flip the spin of a proton mostly falls in the radiowave region.",
        "b": "The splitting of the spin states depends on the strength of the magnetic field applied. Stronger magnetic field will split them more.",
        "c": "When the protons absorb energy and undergo flipping, they are known to be in resonance with the incoming radiowave frequency.",
        "d": "Protons aligned along the field have lower energy while those aligned opposite the field have higher energy."

      "question": "3. What is the value of the chemical shift Î´ for an absorption at 1800 Hz from tetramethylsilane (TMS) using an NMR spectrometer with an operating frequency of 300 MHz?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "1.66 ppm",
        "b": "16.6 ppm",
        "c": "6.0 ppm",

        "a": "",
        "b": "",
        "c": "chemical shift = (frequency of absorption / frequency of operation ) ppm",

      "question": "4. Which of the following compounds has the MOST deshielded methyl protons?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "tetramethylsilane",
        "b": "methyl fluoride",
        "c": "methanol",
        "d": "methylamine"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Deshielding depends upon the electron withdrawing power of the attached atoms/group. Silicon has low electronegativity due to which it cannot withdraw much of the electron towards itself from the C-H bond.",
        "b": "Fluorine has the highest electronegativity in the periodic table due to which it will withdraw the electrons from the C-H bond by the highest amount among these.",
        "c": "Oxygen is lower in electronegativity than Fluorine and hence the methyl protons will be less deshielded than with F.",
        "d": "Nitrogen is much lower in electronegativity than Fluorine and hence the methyl protons will be less deshielded than with F."

        "b": "1",

        "d": "3"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "The number of signals depend on the number of non - equivalent protons (H) in the molecule. In this molecule, there are 5 different types of protons namely CH&#83233, CH&#83232, ortho H, meta H and para H.",
